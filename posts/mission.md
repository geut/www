A well defined toolbox is quite important before starting any kind of job. **JavaScript** and **Node.js** become then our cohesive _“glue”_ for most of the challenges we may face. This apparent simple statement comprises a coherent strategy when a project starts.

We have **full commitment** with every decision we make. This is not a casual choice. It is the reason of our success.
We are a solid unity. Every partner will be ready to assist you considering the spirit of the group: _"Different roles with a unique goal"_  

We transform and _evolve_ from the changes that work experiences provoke day by day. Our experience is an asset.
We will be ready to listen to you, for real. We make  room for improvement and feedback. _You are important to_ **GEUT**.


_We’re active advocates, users and contributors of Open Source technologies and practices._
